# Day 8: Simple Code Organization

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Learn to organize code with simple structures
- Understand basic functions and how to group related code
- Practice creating simple, reusable code pieces
- Build confidence with basic programming organization

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1. Simple Structures
- **struct**: Group related variables together
- **Simple Data**: Store information in organized way
- **Basic Access**: Use dot notation to access data
- **Real Examples**: Student info, book data, calculator

### 2. Basic Functions
- **Function Basics**: Group code that does one thing
- **Simple Parameters**: Pass data to functions
- **Return Values**: Get results back from functions
- **Code Reuse**: Write once, use many times

### 3. Code Organization
- **Logical Grouping**: Put similar things together
- **Simple Structure**: Easy to read and understand
- **Step by Step**: Break big problems into small pieces
- **Practice Examples**: Calculator, student records
