```

**The Magic Formula:**
```
Sum of 1 to n = n × (n + 1) / 2
```

**Why does this work?**
- Pair numbers from ends: (1+n) + (2+n-1) + ...
- Each pair sums to (n+1)
- We have n/2 pairs
- Total: n × (n+1) / 2

### 🔢 Finding Multiples

## 📚 Step-by-Step Examples

### 🟢 Example 1: Simple Case

**Input:** `n = 10, m = 3`  
**Output:** `19`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[n=10, m=3] --> B["Total sum: 1+2+...+10"]
    B --> C["= 10×11/2 = 55"]
    
    A --> D["Divisible by 3: 3, 6, 9"]
    D --> E["Count = 10÷3 = 3"]
    E --> F["Sum = 3×1 + 3×2 + 3×3"]
    F --> G["= 3×6/2 = 18"]
    
    C --> H["Result = 55 - 2×18"]
    G --> H
    H --> I["= 55 - 36 = 19 ✅"]
    
    style A fill:#e8f5e8
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style G fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#c8e6c9
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**
1. **Calculate total sum:** 1+2+3+...+10 = 10×11/2 = 55
2. **Find divisible numbers:** 3, 6, 9 (count = 3)
3. **Sum of divisible:** 3+6+9 = 3×(1+2+3) = 3×6/2 = 18
4. **Final answer:** 55 - 2×18 = 19

### 🔴 Example 2: m = 1 (All Numbers Divisible)

**Input:** `n = 5, m = 1`  
**Output:** `-15`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[n=5, m=1] --> B["Total sum: 1+2+3+4+5"]
    B --> C["= 5×6/2 = 15"]
    
    A --> D["All numbers divisible by 1"]
    D --> E["Sum = 15"]
    
    C --> F["Result = 15 - 2×15"]
    E --> F
    F --> G["= 15 - 30 = -15 ✅"]
    
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style G fill:#ffcdd2
```

**Insight:** When m=1, everyone loses double their points!

### 🟡 Example 3: m Greater Than n

**Input:** `n = 5, m = 10`  
**Output:** `15`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[n=5, m=10] --> B["Total sum: 1+2+3+4+5"]
    B --> C["= 5×6/2 = 15"]

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style I fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Edge Case:** No multiples exist, so nothing is subtracted!

### 🟠 Example 4: Larger Numbers

**Input:** `n = 100, m = 5`  
**Output:** `2950`

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[n=100, m=5] --> B["Total sum = 100×101/2 = 5050"]

    style J fill:#c8e6c9
```

### 💻 The Code

```cpp
int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
    // 🧮 STEP 1: Sum of all integers 1 to n
    int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
    
    // 🔢 STEP 2: Count how many are divisible by m
    int divisibleCount = n / m;
    
    // ✖️ STEP 3: Sum of divisible integers
    // multiples: m, 2m, 3m, ..., km
    // sum: m*(1+2+3+...+k) = m*k*(k+1)/2
    int divisibleSum = m * (divisibleCount * (divisibleCount + 1)) / 2;
    
    // 📊 STEP 4: Calculate final result
    return totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum;
}
```

### 🧠 Understanding Each Formula

**Formula 1: Total Sum**
```
totalSum = n × (n + 1) / 2

Why: (1+n) + (2+n-1) + ... = pairs of (n+1)
     n/2 pairs × (n+1) = n×(n+1)/2

Example: n=5
         1+2+3+4+5 = 5×6/2 = 15 ✓
```

**Formula 2: Divisible Count**
```
divisibleCount = n / m (integer division)

Why: Multiples of m are: m, 2m, 3m, ..., km
     The largest multiple ≤ n is k×m where k = n/m

Example: n=10, m=3
         Multiples: 3, 6, 9 (that's 3 numbers)
         10/3 = 3 ✓
```

**Formula 3: Divisible Sum**
```
divisibleSum = m × (k × (k+1) / 2)
            = m + 2m + 3m + ... + km

Why: Factor out m from each term
     = m×(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k)
     = m × k×(k+1)/2

Example: n=10, m=3, k=3
         3+6+9 = 3×1 + 3×2 + 3×3
              = 3×(1+2+3)
              = 3×(3×4/2)
              = 3×6 = 18 ✓
```

## 🎓 Key Concepts Mastery

### 🧮 Mathematical Patterns

**Pattern 1: Arithmetic Series**
```cpp
// Sum of 1 to n
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2

// Example calculation
n = 10: 10 * 11 / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55
```

**Pattern 2: Multiples Series**
```cpp
// Sum of multiples of m up to n
count = n / m
sum = m * count * (count + 1) / 2

// Example calculation
n=10, m=3: count=3, sum=3*3*4/2=18
```

**Pattern 3: Weighted Difference**
```cpp
// The final formula combines both patterns
result = totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum
```

### ⚡ Why O(1) Instead of O(n)?

Mathematical:    n = 1,000,000 → 4 operations
                 250,000x faster!
```

### 💾 Space Complexity: O(1)

**Why constant space?**
- Only 3 integer variables: totalSum, divisibleCount, divisibleSum
- No arrays, lists, or dynamic memory
- Memory usage is constant regardless of input

## 💼 Interview Questions & Answers

### ❓ Question 1: Why is a formula better than a loop?

**Answer:**  
A loop is O(n) - it gets slower as n increases. A formula is O(1) - it's instant regardless of size.

**Simple Explanation:**  
Calculating the sum of 1 to 1,000,000 with a loop takes time. With a formula, it's always instant:
```cpp
// Loop: slow, gets slower with bigger n
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++) sum += i;

// Formula: fast, always the same speed
sum = n * (n+1) / 2;
```

**Real-world analogy:**  
Counting money by hand (loop) vs. knowing "10 bills × $100/bill = $1000" (formula)

---

### ❓ Question 2: How does the arithmetic series formula work?

**Answer:**  
The key insight is pairing numbers:
```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
= (1+5) + (2+4) + 3
= 6 + 6 + 3
= 3 pairs of 6, plus middle
= 5×6/2
```

**General pattern:**
```
(first + last) + (second + second-to-last) + ...
= (n+1) + (n+1) + ... (n/2 times)
= n × (n+1) / 2
```

---

### ❓ Question 3: Why do we use integer division `n / m`?

**Answer:**  
Integer division automatically gives us the count of complete multiples.

**Example:**
```cpp
n = 10, m = 3
10 / 3 = 3 (exact count of multiples)
         // Multiples are: 3, 6, 9

n = 11, m = 3
11 / 3 = 3 (still 3, we ignore remainder)
         // Multiples are still: 3, 6, 9
         // (12 would be the next, but 12 > 11)
```

**Key Insight:**  
Integer division automatically rounds down, giving us exactly what we need!

---

### ❓ Question 4: How do we handle the "divisible" sum?

**Answer:**  
We recognize the divisible numbers form their own arithmetic series:
```
Divisible by m: m, 2m, 3m, ..., km
             = m×(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k)
             = m × k×(k+1)/2
```

**Example:**
```
n=10, m=3, k=3
Multiples: 3, 6, 9
         = 3×1, 3×2, 3×3
         = 3×(1+2+3)
         = 3 × (3×4/2)
         = 3 × 6 = 18
```

---

### ❓ Question 5: What if n or m is very large?

**Answer:**  
No problem! The algorithm is still O(1) and works for any positive integers.

**Optimization:**  
The formula is so efficient that even for n = 10^18 (a billion billion), it calculates instantly!

---

### ❓ Question 6: Why does the problem ask for "2× divisibleSum"?

**Answer:**  
It's the problem's definition - people divisible by m lose double their contribution.

**Mathematical interpretation:**
```
Net gain = (Everyone's sum) - (Double penalty for divisible)
         = totalSum - 2×divisibleSum
```

**Example logic:**
```
Person 1: gains 1 point
Person 2: gains 2 points
Person 3: gains 3 points BUT loses 2×3=6 (divisible by 3)
         Net: 3 - 2×3 = -3

This is built into: totalSum - 2×divisibleSum
```

---

### ❓ Question 7: Can we optimize this further?

**Answer:**  
No - O(1) is the absolute best possible! We can't do better than constant time.

**Why not?**
- We must read the input (O(1) with 2 integers)
- We must return output (O(1) with 1 integer)
- The algorithm already uses constant operations

**The Mathematical Ceiling:**  
O(1) is the theoretical maximum - once you reach it, there's nowhere else to go!

---

### ❓ Question 8: What if m doesn't divide n evenly?

**Answer:**  
Integer division handles it perfectly! The remainder is ignored.

**Example:**
```
n = 11, m = 3
Multiples: 3, 6, 9 (not 12, because 12 > 11)
Count: 11 / 3 = 3 (the .666... is ignored)
Sum: 3 × (3×4/2) = 18

The formula doesn't care about remainders!
```

**Why it works:**  
Integer division in C++ automatically truncates (rounds down), which is exactly what we need for counting complete multiples.

---

### ❓ Question 9: How does the formula scale to large numbers?

**Answer:**  
Perfectly! Mathematical formulas scale linearly in complexity, but stay O(1) in time.

**Scaling example:**
```
n = 100:        Formula works instantly
n = 10,000:     Formula works instantly
n = 1,000,000:  Formula works instantly
n = 10^18:      Formula works instantly
```

**No Performance Degradation:**  
A loop at n=10^18 would crash or take forever. The formula? Still 4 operations.

---

### ❓ Question 10: What's the difference between formula and loop?

**Answer:**  

**Loop Approach (Naive):**
```cpp
int result = 0;
for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    result += i;
    if(i % m == 0) result -= 2*i;
}
```
- Time: O(n) - could take seconds for large n
- Space: O(1)
- Simple to understand
- Very slow for big numbers

**Formula Approach (Smart):**
```cpp
int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
int count = n / m;
int divisibleSum = m * (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
return totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum;
```
- Time: O(1) - always instant
- Space: O(1)
- Requires mathematical thinking
- Ultra-fast for any size

**Interview Perspective:**  
Using loops shows basic understanding. Using formulas shows mastery and optimization skills!

---

### ❓ Question 11: How do you derive the divisible sum formula?

**Answer:**  
Start with the pattern and factor out the common multiple.

**Step-by-step derivation:**
```
Divisible numbers: m, 2m, 3m, ..., km

Sum = m + 2m + 3m + ... + km
    = m×(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k)     [Factor out m]
    = m × k×(k+1)/2               [Use arithmetic series formula]
```

**Proof with example:**
```
n=12, m=4
Multiples: 4, 8, 12 (k=3)

Direct sum: 4 + 8 + 12 = 24
Formula:    4 × (3×4/2) = 4 × 6 = 24 ✓
```

---

### ❓ Question 12: What happens when m = 1?

**Answer:**  
Every number is divisible by 1, so everyone loses double their points!

**Mathematical behavior:**
```
n = 5, m = 1
Total sum: 15
Divisible: all of them (15)
Result: 15 - 2×15 = -15

Everyone has a negative score!
```

**Real-world interpretation:**  
If m=1, the penalty system is so harsh that everyone ends up in the red!

---

## 🔑 Quick Reference

### Essential Code Patterns

```cpp
// Total sum of 1 to n
int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;

// Count multiples of m
int count = n / m;

// Sum of multiples
int divisibleSum = m * (count * (count + 1)) / 2;

// Final calculation
int result = totalSum - 2 * divisibleSum;
```

### Mental Math Shortcuts

**For calculating n × (n+1) / 2:**
```
n = 5:   5 × 6 / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15
n = 10:  10 × 11 / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55
n = 100: 100 × 101 / 2 = 5050
```

**For counting multiples:**
```
n = 20, m = 5:  20 / 5 = 4 multiples (5,10,15,20)
n = 20, m = 3:  20 / 3 = 6 multiples (3,6,9,12,15,18)
n = 20, m = 7:  20 / 7 = 2 multiples (7,14)
```
