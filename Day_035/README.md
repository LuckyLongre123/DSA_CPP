## üåü Introduction to 2D Arrays

### What is a 2D Array?
A two-dimensional array is a data structure that stores elements in a tabular format with rows and columns. It's essentially an array of arrays, where each element is accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

### Real-world Analogies
1. **Chess Board**: 8x8 grid representing positions
2. **Spreadsheet**: Rows and columns of data
3. **Digital Images**: Pixels arranged in a 2D grid
4. **Game Boards**: Tic-tac-toe, Sudoku, or Minesweeper grids

### Why are 2D Arrays Important?
- Fundamental data structure in computer science
- Used in image processing, game development, and scientific computing
- Common in dynamic programming problems
- Frequently tested in coding interviews
- Foundation for graph algorithms on grids

## üîç Problem Understanding

### Problem Statement
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Detailed Explanation
- **Spiral Order**: Traverse the matrix in a clockwise spiral starting from the top-left corner
- **Movement Pattern**: Right ‚Üí Down ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Up, then repeat with inner layers
- **Termination**: When all elements are processed

### Example Walkthrough
```
Input: [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

### Visual Representation
```
Original Matrix:
1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3
        ‚Üì
4 ‚Üí 5   6
‚Üë       ‚Üì
7 ‚Üê 8 ‚Üê 9

Spiral Order: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 6 ‚Üí 9 ‚Üí 8 ‚Üí 7 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
```

### Key Observations
1. The spiral moves in layers (outer to inner)
2. Each complete cycle has 4 directional moves
3. The pattern repeats with smaller boundaries
4. Need to handle edge cases for single row/column matrices

## üß† Approach & Intuition

### Core Idea: Boundary Shrinking
1. **Initialize Boundaries**:
   - `top`: First row
   - `bottom`: Last row
   - `left`: First column
   - `right`: Last column

2. **Traversal Order**:
   - Move right along the top row (left to right)
   - Move down the right column (top+1 to bottom)
   - If `top < bottom` and `left < right`:
     - Move left along the bottom row (right-1 to left)
     - Move up the left column (bottom-1 to top+1)

3. **Boundary Adjustment**:
   - After completing a full cycle:
     - `top++`, `bottom--` (move inward vertically)
     - `left++`, `right--` (move inward horizontally)

### Why This Approach Works
- **Efficiency**: Each element is processed exactly once
- **In-Place**: No extra space needed (except for output)
- **Generalization**: Works for any m x n matrix
- **Termination**: Loop continues until all elements are processed

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m√ón) - Each element is visited exactly once
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Constant extra space (output array not counted)

## üíª Solution Code

### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> spiralOrder(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (matrix.empty() || matrix[0].empty()) return result;
        
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size();
        int top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
            // Traverse from left to right
            for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                result.push_back(matrix[top][i]);
            }
            top++;
            
            // Traverse from top to bottom
            for (int i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
                result.push_back(matrix[i][right]);
            }
            right--;
            
            if (top <= bottom) {  // Check if there are more rows
                // Traverse from right to left
                for (int i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                    result.push_back(matrix[bottom][i]);
                }
                bottom--;
            }
            
            if (left <= right) {  // Check if there are more columns
                // Traverse from bottom to top
                for (int i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                    result.push_back(matrix[i][left]);
                }
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Handling

### 1. Single Row Matrix

```
- Only the right traversal is needed
- Other traversals are skipped

### 2. Single Column Matrix

Output: [1,2,3,4]
```
- Right and down traversals are sufficient
- Left and up are skipped

### 3. Single Element Matrix
```
Input: [[42]]
Output: [42]
```
- Only one element, processed in first traversal

### 4. Empty Matrix
```
Input: []
Output: []
```
- Handle empty input case at the beginning

## üö´ Common Pitfalls & Mistakes

### 1. Off-by-One Errors
- **Mistake**: Incorrect boundary conditions in loops
- **Solution**: Double-check loop conditions and boundary updates

### 2. Missing Edge Cases
- **Mistake**: Not handling single row/column cases
- **Solution**: Add explicit checks before left and up traversals

### 3. Infinite Loops
- **Mistake**: Not updating boundaries correctly
- **Solution**: Ensure boundaries are updated after each traversal

### 4. Incorrect Traversal Order
- **Mistake**: Wrong order of traversals
- **Solution**: Follow Right ‚Üí Down ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Up pattern strictly

## ‚ö° Optimization Techniques

### 1. Early Termination
- If the result size reaches m√ón, we can break early
- Reduces unnecessary iterations in some cases

### 2. Direction Vectors

## üåÄ Problem: Spiral Matrix

### Problem Statement
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.

### Examples
**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```

  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9,10,11,12]
]
Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]
```

### Approach: Boundary Shrinking

#### Intuition
Imagine peeling an orange in a spiral. We can traverse the matrix layer by layer, moving right, down, left, and up, while adjusting our boundaries after each full cycle.

#### Algorithm
1. **Initialize boundaries**:
   - `startingRow` = 0 (top boundary)
   - `endingRow` = rows - 1 (bottom boundary)
   - `startingCol` = 0 (left boundary)
   - `endingCol` = columns - 1 (right boundary)

2. **Traverse in order**:
   - Move right along the top row (increment `startingRow` after)
   - Move down the right column (decrement `endingCol` after)
   - Move left along the bottom row (decrement `endingRow` after)
   - Move up the left column (increment `startingCol` after)

3. **Termination**:
   - Stop when all elements are processed (count == total elements)

#### Visualization
For matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

1. Move right: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3
2. Move down: 6 ‚Üí 9
3. Move left: 8 ‚Üí 7
4. Move up: 4
5. Move right: 5

Final order: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(m√ón) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. We visit each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) extra space (output array not counted as extra space).

### Edge Cases
1. Single row matrix: `[[1,2,3,4]]`
2. Single column matrix: `[[1],[2],[3]]`
3. Single element matrix: `[[42]]`
4. Empty matrix: `[]`
5. Non-square matrices (more rows than columns and vice versa)

### Solution Code
```cpp
// See leetcode_54.cpp for the complete solution
```

## üéØ Key Takeaways
1. **Boundary Management**: The key to solving spiral matrix is managing the four boundaries effectively.
2. **Direction Handling**: The order of traversal (right ‚Üí down ‚Üí left ‚Üí up) is crucial.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop should continue until all elements are processed.
4. **Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases like single row/column matrices.
