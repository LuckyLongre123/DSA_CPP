/*
 * GAME FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
 * 
 * 1. Random number generation
 * 2. Input validation
 * 3. Attempt limiting
 * 4. Hint system (too high/low + closeness)
 * 5. Win/lose conditions
 * 6. Play again functionality
 * 7. Game statistics
 * 
 * CONCEPTS USED:
 * - while loops for game continuation
 * - if-else for decision making
 * - break and continue for loop control
 * - Boolean variables for game state
 * - Random number generation
 * - Input validation
 * 
 * POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * 1. Difficulty levels (different ranges)
 * 2. Score system based on attempts
 * 3. High score tracking
 * 4. Multiple players
 * 5. Hint system improvements
 * 6. Better input validation
 * 7. Color output (if supported)
 * 
 * LEARNING OUTCOMES:
 * - Combining loops and conditionals
 * - Game state management
 * - User experience considerations
 * - Input validation importance
 * - Random number usage
