# Day 2: Control Flow - Decision Making & Loops

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
- Master conditional statements (if, else if, else)
- Understand comparison and logical operators
- Learn different types of loops (for, while, do-while)
- Practice loop control with break and continue

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### 1. Conditional Statements
- **if statement**: Execute code when condition is true
- **else statement**: Execute code when condition is false
- **else if**: Multiple conditions
- **Nested if**: if statements inside other if statements

### 2. Comparison Operators
- `==` Equal to
- `!=` Not equal to
- `>` Greater than
- `<` Less than
- `>=` Greater than or equal to
- `<=` Less than or equal to

### 3. Logical Operators
- `&&` AND (both conditions must be true)
- `||` OR (at least one condition must be true)
- `!` NOT (reverses the condition)

### 4. Loops
- **for loop**: When you know how many times to repeat
- **while loop**: Repeat while condition is true
- **do-while loop**: Execute at least once, then check condition

### 5. Loop Control
- **break**: Exit the loop immediately
- **continue**: Skip current iteration, go to next

## ðŸ’» Practice Files
- `conditionals.cpp` - If-else statements and decision making
- `loops.cpp` - All types of loops with examples
- `number_game.cpp` - Guess the number game project
- `patterns.cpp` - Print various patterns using loops

## ðŸ”¥ Mini Challenges
1. Create a program to check if a number is even or odd
2. Find the largest of three numbers
3. Print multiplication table for any number
4. Create a simple menu system
5. Print patterns like triangles and diamonds

## ðŸ“– Key Concepts to Remember
- Use `==` for comparison, not `=` (assignment)
- Combine conditions with `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR)
- for loops are best when you know iteration count
- while loops are best when condition-dependent
- Always ensure loops have a way to end (avoid infinite loops)
